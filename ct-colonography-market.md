<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The CT Colonography Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CT Scanners Colonoscopy</li><li>MRI Scanners Colonoscopy</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The CT colonography market primarily includes two types of imaging modalities: CT scanners and MRI scanners for colonoscopy. CT scanners utilize X-rays to create detailed cross-sectional images of the colon, allowing for the detection of potential abnormalities like polyps or tumors. MRI scanners, although less commonly used for colonoscopy, provide high-contrast images using magnetic fields and radio waves, offering a non-invasive alternative for assessing colorectal conditions. Both modalities contribute to enhanced diagnostics and patient management in colorectal health.</p></p>
