<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Explosion Proof Fans Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Explosion-proof Centrifugal Fan</li><li>Explosion-proof Axial Flow Fan</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The explosion-proof fan market is categorized primarily into two types: explosion-proof centrifugal fans and explosion-proof axial flow fans. Centrifugal fans are designed to move air or gases in a radial direction, suitable for high-pressure applications and often found in enclosed spaces with potential explosive atmospheres. Axial flow fans, on the other hand, move air parallel to the fan axis, ideal for ventilation and cooling in larger spaces. Both types are critical in ensuring safety and compliance in hazardous environments.</p></p>
